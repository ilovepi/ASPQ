# ASPQ

This project contains the implementation fo the "Amicable Strict Priority Queue"

We have a click implementation for routers and we're going to be developing a server side ASPQ.

ASPQ works much in the same way as Freeze TCP. It's goal is to promote better network utilization, improve congestion conditions, and reliability. 


More information will be forthcomming as our research, and forthcomming report progress.
